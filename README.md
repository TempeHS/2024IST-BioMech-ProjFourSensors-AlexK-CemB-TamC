# ProjFourSensors
## We intend to make Anna a biomedical product to help her with her gaming experience. We are going to make a gesture sensor which represent the WASD buttons for movement in the game. She is going to move in game by doing different types of gestures. We are making this because we want to help Anna improve her gaming experience. Anna has muscular dystrophy so her bones are weakened and she finds that playing games is difficult.
