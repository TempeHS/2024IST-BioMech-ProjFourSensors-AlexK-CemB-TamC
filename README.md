# ProjFourSensors
## We intend to make Anna a biomedical product to help her with her gaming experience. We are going to make 4 gesture sensors which represent the WASD buttons for movement. We are making this because we want to help Anna improve her gaming experience. Anna has muscular dystrophy so her bones are weakened and she finds that playing games is difficult.
